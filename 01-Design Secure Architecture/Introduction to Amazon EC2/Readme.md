<H2> LAB DETAILS </h2>

In this lab, you will gain practical experience using Amazon Machine Images (AMI) to launch Amazon EC2 instances and master the art of using key pairs for SSH authentication to log into your instance. Additionally, you will learn how to create a web page and publish it on your AWS virtual machine.

<h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>

<H3> What is EC2 ? </H3>

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a revolutionary cloud-based web service called Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) that provides unparalleled compute capacity in the cloud. In this cutting-edge platform, users have the ability to rent virtual machines, called instances, that are fully customizable to meet their specific computing needs.

<H3> Here are some additional key points about Amazon EC2: </H3>

<ol>
  
 <li> EC2 provides users with full control over their virtual computing resources, allowing them to customize their instances with their preferred operating system, programming languages, and application servers. </li>
  
 <li> Users can configure security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) to control inbound and outbound traffic to their instances, providing a secure environment for their applications. </li>
  
 <li> EC2 offers various purchasing options, including On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances, allowing users to optimize their costs based on their application requirements. </li>
  
 <li> EC2 provides a wide range of monitoring and logging features, including Amazon CloudWatch, which allows users to monitor their instances, applications, and resources in real-time, and Amazon CloudTrail, which provides a record of all API calls made in their AWS account. </li>
  
 <li> EC2 supports a variety of storage options, including Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), and instance store volumes, providing users with the flexibility to choose the most suitable storage solution for their applications. </li>
  
 <li> EC2 allows users to create custom machine images (AMIs) of their instances, which can be used to launch new instances with the same configuration and software stack, saving time and effort in application deployment. </li>

</ol>
